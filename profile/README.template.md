# EPICS Containers Organization

The epics-containers GitHub organization holds a collection of tools and documentation
for building, deploying and managing containerized EPICS IOCs in a Kubernetes cluster.

Documentation for the framework is available at
[epics-containers.github.io](https://epics-containers.github.io/).

Please contribute with comments and suggestions in the
[Discussion Forum](https://github.com/epics-containers/epics-containers.github.io/discussions)
or the [Wiki](https://github.com/epics-containers/epics-containers.github.io/wiki).
If you discover issues with the framework please raise them in the
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/epics-containers/epics-containers.github.io/issues)


Latest News: the framework is in the process of a major overhaul. Consequently
the tutorials are currently out of date. The new approach is greatly simplified
and will have a new tutorial By end of November 2023.
